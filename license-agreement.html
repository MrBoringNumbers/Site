            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>A Non-Exclusive Recording Contract is an agreement under which copyright on certain recordings is assigned (from Artist to Label), but the Artist is not engaged exclusively by the Label as a recording and performing musician. Therefore, the Artist is free to assign copyrights not covered in this agreement to other labels. This contract is for a label looking to license recordings but do not wish to tie up an artist exclusively for several years or for several releases.

            <h2>Grant of Rights</h2>
            <p>This is an agreement between I, the Artist, and SixtySevenRadio, the Label. I agree to allow the Label to distribute select songs that both I and the Label agree upon. Preexisting songs will require the Label to create a new version to distribute and distinguish from the original track. I agree that the Label has the right to create a new version of the song that they deem as commercially and technically satisfactory for the manufacture and sale of records. I agree that the Label's version of the song is exclusive to the Label and that it cannot be redistributed by any other entity. I agree to allow the Label to use the selected works and the Artist's likeness with third party entities for promotional strategies. I understand that streaming profits (excluding fees and expenses) will be divided evenly between the Artist and the Label. If the Artist's work involves other individuals, it is the Artist's responsibility to distribute profit among these individuals. I understand that this is not an exclusive agreement and that I am not permanently bound to the Label. If I wish to no longer have my work under the Label, I will communicate with the Label and request termination. The Label will inform its aggregator and request the removal of all related works.
